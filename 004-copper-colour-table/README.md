# 004 - Copper Colour Table
This example extends 003-computed-copper and extends it to read the background colour from a table of values.

Part of the copper list is generated by the code. 
A block of memory os reserved and a routine generates the copper wait and background colour bar creation.

There is no animation on this example.

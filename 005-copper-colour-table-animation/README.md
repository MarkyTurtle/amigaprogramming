# 005 - Copper Colour Table Animation
This example extends 004-copper-colour-table and extends it to animate the colour bars using a sine table.

Part of the copper list is generated by the code. 
A block of memory is reserved and a routine generates the copper wait and background colour bar creation.

The colour bars are animated by duplicating the colour table (three times the height),
and then using a sine table to animate the start offset every frame during the vertical blank interval.
